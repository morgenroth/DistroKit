DistroKit
---------

This is the main repository for DistroKit, an Embedded Linux Board
Support Package (BSP) for the PTXdist [1] Build System.

The main task for PTXdist is to build a root filesystem and a flash
image for the embedded system. PTXdist has a concept of separating the
software configuration from the hardware platforms, so the first
decision to be made is to select for which hardware DistroKit shall be
built.


Installing PTXdist
------------------

DistroKit is built with ptxdist. In order to install ptxdist, download
the tarball from [2]:

$ wget \
  http://www.pengutronix.de/software/ptxdist/download/ptxdist-2016.01.0.tar.bz2

Extract the tarball:

$ tar xf ptxdist-2016.01.0 && cd ptxdist-2016.01.0

Go to the extracted directory and run

$ ./configure && make && sudo make install


Selecting the Platform
----------------------

For the different hardware platforms, see the instructions about

- how to install the toolchain
- how to select the right platform
- how to build the rootfs

in README.<platform>.

In order to build a BSP, you need a toolchain. The easiest way to get a
toolchain is to install the debian packages for OSELAS.Toolchain:

  http://www.pengutronix.de/oselas/toolchain/

If you want to build the toolchain yourself, you can download the
toolchain sources from

  http://www.pengutronix.de/oselas/toolchain/download/

and build them manually.


Building DistroKit
------------------

Now everything is prepared to build the BSP:

$ ptxdist images

PTXdist determines the number of CPUs on your computer and runs the
compiler with <twice the number of CPUs> instances in parallel.
Nevertheless, building a root filesystem from the sources needs some
time.
